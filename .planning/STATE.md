## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Claude Agent SDK (v0.1.x) identified as potential transport foundation but alpha-status risk noted. Adapter interface recommended to isolate SDK calls.
- [Roadmap]: Read-only principle for .planning/ files -- all mutations flow through GSD via Claude subprocess.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Claude Agent SDK is alpha (v0.1.x) -- needs hands-on spike during Phase 1 planning to validate SDK vs raw subprocess.
- GSD non-interactive question mapping undocumented -- needs empirical testing during Phase 2 planning.
