# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-22T16:30:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Previous audit:** 2026-02-22T15:00:00Z (26/30 — Phase 4 verification gap)

## Executive Summary

All gaps identified in the previous audit are now closed. Phase 6 (gap closure) wired the orphaned DECISION_NEEDED event emission into 3 API functions, created the missing Phase 4 VERIFICATION.md, and resolved all stale REQUIREMENTS.md traceability entries. The milestone achieves 30/30 requirements satisfied with full 3-source cross-reference verification. All 7 phases have independent VERIFICATION.md files. All 6 E2E flows complete end-to-end. 8 non-blocking tech debt items remain.

## Scores

| Requirements | 30/30 | All satisfied (up from 26/30) |
| Phases | 7/7 | All verified (Phase 4 gap closed by Phase 6) |
| Integration | 30/30 | All wiring confirmed (DECISION_NEEDED now has 3 producers) |
| E2E Flows | 6/6 | All user flows complete end-to-end |

## Integration Check Results

### Cross-Phase Wiring: 30/30 verified

All requirement integration paths confirmed by integration checker. Zero missing connections. Zero broken flows.

**Previously orphaned DECISION_NEEDED: NOW WIRED**
- 3 producers in `api.py`: `create_project()` (line 64), `plan_phase()` (line 125), `execute_phase()` (line 187)
- Gated on `if not answer_overrides` — emits when defaults used, suppressed when overrides provided
- CLI handler registered via `_make_cli_bus()` iterating all `EventType` members
- 6 tests confirm emission and suppression behavior

### E2E Flows: 6/6 complete

1. `openclawpack --version` without Claude Code — PKG-04 holds
2. `openclawpack status --project-dir <path>` — structured JSON returned
3. `openclawpack --output-format text status` — human-readable output
4. `from openclawpack import get_status; await get_status(...)` — typed Pydantic return
5. EventBus + cli_json_handler — all 5 event types emit correctly to stderr
6. `openclawpack projects add/list/remove` — full CRUD lifecycle

### Orphaned Exports (informational, not breaks)

3 orphaned sync wrappers (`*_workflow_sync`) and `run_gsd_command_sync` exist but are valid public API surface superseded by the async `api.py` facade. Not wiring breaks.

## Tech Debt

### By Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- `run_sync()` uses `anyio.from_thread.run()` — dead code, never called
- ROADMAP.md 01-03 checkbox stale

**Phase 2: Core Commands**
- `plan_phase_workflow` and `execute_phase_workflow` return `Any` annotation
- 5 orphaned `_sync` wrapper functions — dead code

**Phase 3: Reliability**
- `--output-format` global-only (usability friction)

**Phase 4: Library API and Events**
- SUMMARY files missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter field
- `output/__init__.py` eagerly imports formatter.py

**CLI**
- `cli.py` header comment stale (says no module-level command imports, but `projects_app` imported at line 136 — does not break PKG-04)

**Total: 8 items across 5 categories — all non-blocking**

## Test Suite

| Suite | Passed | Failed | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| Unit tests | 382 | 0 | Full green |
| Integration tests | 0 | 1 | Pre-existing: requires live Claude Code subprocess (environment-blocked, not a regression) |
| **Total** | **382** | **1** | 1 failure is pre-existing, not a regression |
