# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-22T15:00:00Z
**Status:** GAPS FOUND
**Previous audit:** 2026-02-22T12:00:00Z (20/30 — phases 3-5 not yet executed)

## Executive Summary

All 6 phases are executed and 5 of 6 have independent verification. Phase 4 (Library API and Events) is missing its VERIFICATION.md, making INT-01 through INT-04 unverifiable through the standard 3-source cross-reference. The integration checker confirmed the wiring is mostly correct, but `DECISION_NEEDED` events are never emitted despite being defined and registered. REQUIREMENTS.md traceability is stale for 10 entries.

## Scores

| Dimension | Score | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Requirements | 26/30 | 26 satisfied, 4 partial (verification gap) |
| Phases | 5/6 | Phase 4 missing VERIFICATION.md |
| Integration | 29/30 | 1 orphaned event type (DECISION_NEEDED) |
| E2E Flows | 6/6 | All user flows complete end-to-end |

### Partial Requirements (4/30) — Phase 4 Verification Gap

| Requirement | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | Traceability | Final Status |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| INT-01 | **MISSING** | 04-02: body only (no frontmatter) | Pending (stale) | **partial** |
| INT-02 | **MISSING** | 04-01, 04-02: body only | Pending (stale) | **partial** |
| INT-03 | **MISSING** | 04-01, 04-02: body only | Pending (stale) | **partial** |
| INT-04 | **MISSING** | 04-01, 04-02: body only | Pending (stale) | **partial** |

**Root cause:** Phase 4 execution completed but no VERIFICATION.md was created. The phase verifier was either not run or its output was lost. SUMMARY bodies claim all 4 requirements satisfied, and the integration checker confirmed wiring is mostly correct — but no independent phase-level verification exists.

**Additional concern for INT-03:** `DECISION_NEEDED` EventType is defined in `events/types.py`, registered on the CLI bus in `_make_cli_bus()`, but never emitted by any producer in `api.py` or any workflow function. Library consumers subscribing to `decision_needed` events would never receive callbacks.

## Integration Check Results

### Cross-Phase Wiring: 29/30 verified

All phase exports are consumed by downstream phases. One orphaned event type found.

**Orphaned: DECISION_NEEDED (EventType)** — defined, registered, but never emitted. The event infrastructure exists but has no trigger point. Affects INT-03 and INT-04.

### E2E Flows: 6/6 complete

1. `openclawpack --version` without Claude Code — PKG-04 holds
2. `openclawpack status --project-dir <path>` — structured JSON returned
3. `openclawpack --output-format text status` — human-readable output
4. `from openclawpack import get_status; await get_status(...)` — typed Pydantic return
5. EventBus + cli_json_handler — 4/5 event types emit correctly to stderr
6. `openclawpack projects add/list/remove` — full CRUD lifecycle

### Wiring Observations (Non-Breaking)

- `plan_phase_workflow` and `execute_phase_workflow` return `Any` instead of `CommandResult` (annotation only)
- `output/__init__.py` eagerly imports `formatter.py` (safe — no SDK chain)
- `api.py` imports `EventBus`/`EventType` at module level (safe — events package has no SDK chain)
- `cli.py` imports `projects_app` at module level (safe — only Typer + Pydantic)
- `--output-format` is global-only; post-subcommand placement fails with exit code 2 (by design)

## Tech Debt

### By Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation**
- `run_sync()` uses `anyio.from_thread.run()` — dead code, never called
- ROADMAP.md 01-03 checkbox stale

**Phase 2: Core Commands**
- `plan_phase_workflow` and `execute_phase_workflow` return `Any` annotation
- 5 orphaned `_sync` wrapper functions — dead code

**Phase 3: Reliability**
- `--output-format` global-only (usability friction)

**Phase 4: Library API and Events**
- SUMMARY files missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter field
- `output/__init__.py` eagerly imports formatter.py

**Tracking**
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability has 10 stale "Pending" entries for completed requirements

**Total: 8 items across 5 categories**

## Recommendations

1. **Run Phase 4 verifier** to create the missing VERIFICATION.md and close INT-01 through INT-04
2. **Add DECISION_NEEDED emit** in answer injection or workflow checkpoint paths for full INT-03 compliance
3. **Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability** — mark 10 completed requirements from Pending to Complete
4. **Fix ROADMAP.md** stale plan checkboxes
